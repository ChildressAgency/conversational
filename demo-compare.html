              <h3>Pricing</h3>
              <p>For most businesses, the budget will greatly affect their decision. Conversational offers three packages ranging from 100 minutes to 500 minutes with price per minute ranging from $1.16 to $1.29. If you are a high volume customer, you will need to contact the company to have a customized package designed for you.</p>
              <p>With Answer Connect, you can choose from three packages, as well. They range from 135 to 450 minutes and the price ranges from $0.99 per minute to $1.29 per minute, depending on the package you choose. They will also provide a custom quote for any higher volume customers.</p>
              <h3>Fast Service to Capture All Your Leads</h3>
              <p>Answer Connect states they are 20% faster than the industry standard. This isnâ€™t saying much when it comes to answer time. If you let the phone ring more than twice, itâ€™s too slow. With Conversational, 99% of your calls will be answered on the first ring and the phone will never ring three times.</p>
              <p>Along with a fast answer time, you will have all of your leads captured. When somebody is ready to answer your phone fast, you get every lead and no call goes missed. This is a benefit both companies provide as they both provide live phone answering services.</p>

              <h3>Do you Really Need 24/7 Coverage?</h3>
              <p>Part of the reason Answer Connect charges a little bit more per minute is to offer 24/7 coverage. Even though you only pay per minute, they still have to staff their call centers during every hour of every day, which can be expensive.</p>
              <p>Some businesses need 24/7 coverage, but not all businesses need this extended coverage. If you are a common 9am to 5pm business, Conversational will already help you expand your phone hours to 7am to 8pm. This gives you an added five hours per day, along with weekends and holidays. For some businesses, this is plenty and the added hours past 8pm or before 7am are simply unnecessary.</p>
              <p>Paying a company a higher rate when you wonâ€™t need them during the late and very early hours may not really help you at all. Itâ€™s better to choose a company offering what you really need. If you donâ€™t need after-hours emergency phone answering, Conversational may be the better choice.</p>
              <h3>Rest Easy with the Right Phone Answering Service</h3>
              <p>Choosing Conversational as your live answering service will provide you with plenty of benefits. Since the service will be branded to your company, you donâ€™t ever need to answer an incoming call again. Let the virtual receptionists handle it and if the call needs to be forwarded to you, then you can answer the phone.</p>
              <p>Answer Connect provides a solid phone answering service, but they may not give you the same experience as Conversational. The prices for the lower monthly packages are a bit higher, as well. Itâ€™s a close battle between Conversational and Answer Connect, as they are very similar.</p>
              <p>If you want to gain time and increase productivity, adding Conversational to your team will make a huge difference. No call will ever go missed again and you can expand your phone hours. This could lead to more sales, more appointments and more profits.</p>
              <p>For small businesses looking to turn their calls over to the professionals, Conversational appears to be the right choice.
